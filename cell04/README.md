## Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise to upcase_it.py

**Description:**
This exercise converts a user-provided word to uppercase and prints the result.

**File:** `upcase_it.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the uppercase version of the user-provided word.

### Exercise to age.py

**Description:**
This exercise calculates and prints the user’s age for the current year and in future years (10, 20, and 30 years from now). It handles invalid inputs.

**File:** `age.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the user’s current age and their age in 10, 20, and 30 years.

### Exercise to calculator.py

**Description:**
This exercise performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication) on two user-provided numbers and prints the results. It also handles invalid inputs.

**File:** `calculator.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the results of addition, subtraction, integer division, and multiplication for the two input numbers.

### Exercise to float.py

**Description:**
This exercise determines if a user-provided number is an integer or a decimal and prints the result. It handles invalid inputs.

**File:** `float.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints whether the user-provided number is an integer or a decimal.

### Exercise to round_up.py

**Description:**
This exercise rounds up a user-provided number to the nearest integer and prints the result.

**File:** `round_up.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the user-provided number rounded up to the nearest integer.

### Exercise to up_low.py

**Description:**
This exercise swaps the case of each letter in the user-provided input (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa) and prints the result.

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the user-provided input with all letter cases swapped.

## How to Run the Exercises

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Clone the repository or download the files from this directory.

2. **Save the Files:**
   - Ensure each file (`upcase_it.py`, `age.py`, `calculator.py`, `float.py`, `round_up.py`, and `up_low.py`) is saved in a directory on your local machine.

3. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute each file using the Python interpreter with the following commands:
     ```bash
     chmod +x upcase_it.py
     ./upcase_it.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x age.py
     ./age.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x calculator.py
     ./calculator.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x float.py
     ./float.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x round_up.py
     ./round_up.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x up_low.py
     ./up_low.py
     ```

5. **View the Output:**
   - The output will be displayed in your terminal or command prompt.
