## Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise to25.py

**Description:**
This exercise prompts the user to enter a number less than or equal to 25 and then prints a message for each number from the input up to 25. It also handles non-numeric inputs.

**File:** `to25.py`

**Expected Output:**
- If the input number is less than or equal to 25, it prints messages from the input number up to 25.
- If the input number is greater than 25: `Error`
- If the input is not a number: `Oops! Número inválido. Tente novamente...`


### Exercise multiplication_table.py

**Description:**
This exercise generates and prints a multiplication table for a given number, showing the results for multiples from 0 to 9.

**File:** `multiplication_table.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the multiplication table for the input number, showing results for multiples from 0 to 9.

### Exercise i_got_that.py

**Description:**
This exercise continuously prompts the user for input until they type "STOP", after which it breaks the loop.

**File:** `i_got_that.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Continuously prompts for user input until "STOP" is entered.


### Exercise advanced_mult.py

**Description:**
This exercise generates and prints a multiplication table for numbers from 0 to 10. It handles command-line arguments to control the execution.

**File:** `advanced_mult.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints multiplication tables for numbers from 0 to 10, formatted as a single line for each number.


## How to Run the Exercises

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Clone the repository or download the files from this directory.

2. **Save the Files:**
   - Ensure each file (`to25.py`, `multiplication_table.py`, `i_got_that.py`, and `advanced_mult.py`) is saved in a directory on your local machine.

3. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute each file using the Python interpreter with the following commands:
     ```bash
     chmod +x to25.py 
     ./to25.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x multiplication_table.py
     ./multiplication_table.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x i_got_that.py
     ./i_got_that.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x advanced_mult.py
     ./advanced_mult.py
     ```

5. **View the Output:**
   - The output will be displayed in your terminal or command prompt.
