## Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise to hello_all.py

**Description:**
This exercise demonstrates a basic function that prints a greeting message to everyone.

**File:** `hello_all.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints "Hello, everyone!"


### Exercise to upcase_it.py

**Description:**
This exercise defines a function that converts a given string to uppercase.

**File:** `upcase_it.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints "HELLO"


### Exercise to downcase_all.py

**Description:**
This exercise handles command-line arguments to convert them to lowercase. If no arguments are provided, it returns "none".

**File:** `downcase_all.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Converts all command-line arguments to lowercase and prints them, or prints "none" if no arguments are provided.


### Exercise to greetings_for_all.py

**Description:**
This exercise defines a function that returns a greeting message. It handles different types of input and provides appropriate responses.

**File:** `greetings_for_all.py`


**Expected Output:**
- Prints personalized greetings for various inputs, including handling non-string inputs with an error message.


### Exercise to methods_everywhere.py

**Description:**
This exercise demonstrates functions to shrink or enlarge strings based on their length. It uses command-line arguments to process strings.

**File:** `methods_everywhere.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Processes command-line arguments by shrinking or enlarging them to exactly 8 characters, or printing them as is if they are already 8 characters long.

### Exercise to scope_that.py

**Description:**
This exercise explores variable scope by demonstrating how a function modifies a variable and how it affects the variable outside the function.

**File:** `scope_that.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Prints the value of `number_var` before and after calling `add_one()`, showing that the variable outside the function remains unchanged.

## How to Run the Exercises

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Clone the repository or download the files from this directory.

2. **Save the Files:**
   - Ensure each file (`hello_all.py`, `upcase_it.py`, `downcase_all.py`, `greetings_for_all.py`, `methods_everywhere.py`, `scope_that.py`) is saved in a directory on your local machine.

3. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute each file using the Python interpreter with the following commands:
     ```bash
     chmod +x hello_all.py
     ./hello_all.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x upcase_it.py
     ./upcase_it.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x downcase_all.py
     ./downcase_all.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x greetings_for_all.py
     ./greetings_for_all.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x methods_everywhere.py
     ./methods_everywhere.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x scope_that.py
     ./scope_that.py
     ```

5. **View the Output:**
   - The output will be displayed in your terminal or command prompt.
