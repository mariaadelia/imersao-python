## How to Run the Exercises

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Clone the repository or download the files from this directory.

2. **Save the Files:**
   - Ensure each file (`your_namebook.py`, `family_affairs.py`, `help_your_professor.py`, and `persons_of_interest.py`) is saved in a directory on your local machine.

3. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute each file using the Python interpreter with the following commands:
     ```bash
     chmod +x your_namebook.py 
     ./your_namebook.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x family_affairs.py 
     ./family_affairs.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x help_your_professor.py 
     ./help_your_professor.py
     ```
     ```bash
     chmod +x persons_of_interest.py 
     ./persons_of_interest.py
     ```

5. **View the Output:**
