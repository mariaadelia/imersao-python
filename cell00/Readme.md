## Exercise 1

### Description

This exercise involves printing a simple string to the console. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the `print` function in Python.

### Code

```python
print("42")
```

### Expected Output

```
42
```

### Explanation

- `print("42")`: This statement outputs the string `"42"` to the console. The `print` function is used to display text or other data types in Python.

## Exercise 2

### Description

This exercise also focuses on printing a string, but with a different message. It helps reinforce the use of the `print` function.

### Code

```python
print("Hello World")
```

### Expected Output

```
Hello World
```

### Explanation

- `print("Hello World")`: This statement outputs the string `"Hello World"` to the console. It's a common introductory exercise in programming to test the basic functionality of printing to the console.

## How to Run the Exercises

1. **Save the Code:**
   - Create a new file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `exercise1.py` and `exercise2.py`).
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the respective files.

2. **Run the Code:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
   - Execute the file using the Python interpreter with the command:
     ```

     ```
     and
     ```
     python exercise2.py
     ```

3. **View the Output:**
   - The output should be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.

## Additional Information

- **Python Version:** These exercises are compatible with Python 3.x.
- **Learning Objective:** These exercises help in understanding the basics of using the `print` function in Python.
